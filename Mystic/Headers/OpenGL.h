/*
Getting as much OpenGL stuff into a single header as much as possible. 
GLM should be added here as well I believe. Also add the Typedefs for GLM here so this is an all around include header 
for my common openGL functionality. 
Is GML OpenGL though? I can think of times I might want it without OpenGL being present. But then again OpenGL is almost always present.

Can #ifdef SDL2 functionality etc into this later.
